## Find the number of sub-palindromes of a string of length n.

A string is called a palindrome, if it is read equally from left to right, and from right to left. For example, the lines "abba" and "ata" are palindromes.

A substring of some string is a nonempty sequence of consecutive characters in the original string.

Write a program that calculates how many substrings of this string are palindromes.

### INPUT

In a single line of the input contains a string consisting of characters with ASCII codes from 33 to 127. A string length does not exceed 10^5.

### OUTPUT
